## Modules

The project is divided into relatively-independent modules, which are detected and built by our `cmake` build system.



### Creating Modules

A module is a directory in `modules` with a `CMakeLists.txt` file inside.
Build targets for a module are created using the `arepa_create_*` functions, and can be interacted with like standard cmake targets.

#### Template: Static Libraries

```cmake
include("${AREPA_CONFIG_CXX}")   # Include the build system functions

arepa_create_module(my_module)   # Creates a static library module
arepa_target_cxx(my_module)      # Configures the module to use C++
```


#### Template: Executables

```cmake
include("${AREPA_CONFIG_CXX}")   # Include the build system functions

arepa_create_executable(my_executable "executable")
arepa_target_cxx(my_executable)  # Configures the module to use C++
```



### Using Libraries

Various libraries can be easily included using simple `arepa_use_*` functions.

```cmake
arepa_use_threads(TARGET)     # pthreads
arepa_use_curses(TARGET)      # ncurses
arepa_use_boost(TARGET)       # Boost
arepa_use_boost_beast(TARGET) # Boost::Beast
```
